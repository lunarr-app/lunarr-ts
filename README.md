# Lunarr

Lunarr is a self-hosted media streaming platform for movies and TV shows that aims to provide an alternative to Plex. This project is being developed solely during my free time and is currently a work in progress. The platform will allow users to stream media files from their own servers or cloud storage with ease, and will have a simple and user-friendly media management system. User authentication and authorization will ensure security and privacy, and an intuitive and customizable user interface will make it easy to use.
